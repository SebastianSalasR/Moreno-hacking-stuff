>One of the online tools we look at in this class is 'PimEyes'. PimEyes is an online platform that uses facial recognition technology to search for similar images on the Internet based on an image provided as input. This tool can be useful in detecting a person's personal information, such as their social media profiles, email addresses, phone numbers, first and last names, etc.

>The operation of PimEyes is based on the analysis of facial patterns, which are compared with an online image database to find similarities. The platform also allows searching for images of people who appear in a particular photo, which can be useful in the investigation of stalking cases or in the search for missing persons.
