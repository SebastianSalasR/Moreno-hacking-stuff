## 📖 What is a Digital Signal?

> A **digital signal** is a type of signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values. Typically, these values are **binary** (0 and 1), but other multilevel formats can exist in some systems. Unlike analog signals, which vary continuously, digital signals switch between defined levels, making them highly resistant to noise and distortion.

Digital signals are the foundation of **modern computer networks, storage devices, and digital communications**.

## 📊 Characteristics of Digital Signals
| Characteristic                  | Description                                                  |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discrete**                    | Has a finite number of defined levels (commonly 2: 0 and 1). |
| **Noise-resistant**             | Less sensitive to interference than analog signals.          |
| **Easier to store and process** | Can be easily compressed, encrypted, and corrected.          |
| **Represents abstract data**    | Encodes information for computing, storage, or transmission. |

## 🔢 Representation

A digital signal can be graphically represented as a **square wave**, alternating between two voltage levels (for example, 0V for logic 0 and 5V for logic 1).

Binary Stream: 1011001\text{Binary Stream: 1011001}Binary Stream: 1011001

This corresponds to a series of high (1) and low (0) voltage pulses over time.

## 📈 Encoding Techniques for Digital Signals

Digital signals may use **line encoding techniques** to transmit efficiently:

|Encoding Type|Description|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)**|High/low voltage represents 1/0 without returning to zero.|Ethernet|
|**Manchester**|Voltage transitions represent bits, improving synchronization.|RFID, Ethernet (10BASE-T)|
|**4B/5B Encoding**|4-bit data converted to 5-bit code to ensure frequent transitions.|Fast Ethernet|

## 📡 Digital vs Analog Signals

| Feature              | Digital Signal                        | Analog Signal                  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| **Nature**           | Discrete, fixed values (0s & 1s)      | Continuous, infinite values    |
| **Noise Resistance** | High (robust)                         | Low (prone to interference)    |
| **Data Processing**  | Easier to store, secure, and compress | Simpler for real-world signals |
| **Example**          | Wi-Fi, USB, VoIP                      | AM/FM radio, old phone lines   |
