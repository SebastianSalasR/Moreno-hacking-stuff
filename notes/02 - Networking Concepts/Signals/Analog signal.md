### 📖 What is an Analog Signal?

> An **analog signal** is a type of continuous signal that varies smoothly over time, representing data through changes in amplitude, frequency, or phase. Unlike digital signals — which have discrete, fixed values (usually 0 and 1) — analog signals can take on **any value within a given range**.

They are commonly used to represent real-world phenomena such as sound, light, temperature, and movement.

## 📊 Characteristics of Analog Signals

| Characteristic                 | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous**                 | Changes smoothly over time without discrete steps.       |
| **Infinitely variable**        | Can take on an infinite number of values within a range. |
| **Susceptible to noise**       | More prone to distortion from electrical interference.   |
| **Represents real-world data** | Often models physical measurements like sound or light.  |

## 🎛️ Representation

An analog signal can be represented as a **sine wave** or other continuously varying waveform:

x(t)=A⋅sin⁡(2πft+ϕ)x(t) = A \cdot \sin(2\pi f t + \phi)x(t)=A⋅sin(2πft+ϕ)

- **A** = Amplitude
    
- **f** = Frequency
    
- **t** = Time
    
- **φ** = Phase shift

## 📈 Types of Modulation for Analog Signals

To transmit analog signals over long distances or through different media, the signal is often **modulated**:

| Modulation Type               | Description                               | Example             |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **AM (Amplitude Modulation)** | Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave. | AM radio            |
| **FM (Frequency Modulation)** | Varies the frequency of the carrier wave. | FM radio, audio     |
| **PM (Phase Modulation)**     | Varies the phase of the carrier wave.     | Some wireless links |

## 📊 Advantages & Disadvantages

### ✅ Advantages:

- Represents natural data accurately (voice, sound, light).
    
- Smooth and continuous — no quantization error.
    
- Easier to process in simple analog circuits.
    

### ❌ Disadvantages:

- Prone to **noise** and **signal degradation**.
    
- Difficult to store, compress, and secure.
    
- Less reliable for long-distance transmission without amplification.
