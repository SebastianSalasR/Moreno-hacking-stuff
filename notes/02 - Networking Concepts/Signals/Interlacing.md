## 📺 What is Interlacing in Video?

**Interlaced video** is a technique used to **double the perceived frame rate of a video display** without using extra bandwidth. It was originally developed for analog television systems to improve motion perception and reduce flickering on CRT (cathode ray tube) displays.

## 🧩 How Does It Work?

In an interlaced video:

- Each frame is split into **two fields**:
    
    - 🅰️ **Odd field**: contains the odd-numbered horizontal lines (1, 3, 5…)
        
    - 🅱️ **Even field**: contains the even-numbered horizontal lines (2, 4, 6…)
        
- These two fields are displayed one after the other, alternating rapidly — typically at **1/60th of a second for each field in a 30 fps system** like NTSC.
    

When combined at speed, the human eye perceives them as a **single, full-resolution image**.

## 📈 Why Was Interlacing Used?

- **Reduced bandwidth**: Half the image is transmitted at a time.
    
- **Smoother motion on low frame rates**: 30 full frames per second (fps) becomes 60 half-frames (fields) per second, giving the impression of more fluid motion.
    
- **Prevent flickering**: Especially on older CRT televisions, interlacing reduced flicker compared to progressive scan at the same bandwidth.

## 📊 Interlaced vs Progressive Scan
| 📺 Feature          | 🖥️ Interlaced (i)              | 📽️ Progressive (p)                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| **Image delivery**  | Alternating even/odd lines      | Full frame at once                     |
| **Bandwidth usage** | Lower                           | Higher                                 |
| **Motion clarity**  | Can cause artifacts (combing)   | Smoother, clearer motion               |
| **Modern use**      | Legacy TV systems (480i, 1080i) | Most modern displays (720p, 1080p, 4K) |

## ⚠️ Issues With Interlaced Video Today

On modern displays like LCD, LED, or OLED (which are **progressive by nature**), interlaced content can cause:

- **Combing artifacts** on fast-moving objects.
    
- Lower image clarity unless **deinterlacing algorithms** are applied.

## 🎥 Example of Interlaced Formats

- 📺 **480i** — Standard-definition NTSC TV
    
- 📺 **576i** — Standard-definition PAL/SECAM
    
- 📺 **1080i** — Early HDTV broadcast standard (still used in some cable/satellite channels)
