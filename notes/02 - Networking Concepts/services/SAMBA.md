## What is Samba?

 >Samba is a software suite that provides seamless interoperability between Windows (using the [[SMB]] protocol), Linux, and Unix operating systems in a networked environment. It allows these systems to share files, printers, and other resources, making it possible for users on different platforms to collaborate and access shared resources transparently.
 
 Samba is commonly used for:

- **File sharing**: Linux users can access Windows shared folders and vice versa.
    
- **Printer sharing**: Enables cross-platform printing.
    
- **Authentication & domain control**: Can function as a domain controller (DC) or join an Active Directory (AD) domain.
    
- **Network browsing**: Facilitates resource discovery across the network.
