## ðŸª¶ Definition
> The open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard [protocols](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/).

In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

Each layer of the OSI Model handles a specific job and communicates with the layers above and below itself
