## 📡 Coaxial Cable

### 📖 Definition

A **Coaxial Cable** (or **coax cable**) is a type of electrical cable consisting of a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer protective jacket. It is designed to transmit high-frequency signals with minimal loss and interference.

## 🧱 Physical Description

A coaxial cable typically has four layers:

1. **Inner Conductor**: Carries the electrical signal (usually made of copper or aluminum).
    
2. **Insulating Dielectric Layer**: Separates the inner conductor from the outer shield.
    
3. **Metallic Shield**: A braided mesh or foil that prevents electromagnetic interference (EMI).
    
4. **Outer Jacket**: A plastic or rubber layer that protects the cable from physical damage.

## 📡 Transmission

- **Type**: Electrical signal transmission
    
- **Mode**: Unidirectional or bidirectional (depending on configuration)
    
- **Medium**: Copper-based conductor
    
- **Signal Protection**: The metallic shield helps reduce signal loss and protect against external interference (EMI and crosstalk)

## 📝 Summary

> Coaxial cables remain widely used due to their durability, reliability, and good performance in environments with high electromagnetic interference. While modern fiber optics are replacing coax for high-speed, long-distance data links, coax still plays a critical role in broadcasting, home internet, and legacy networking.
