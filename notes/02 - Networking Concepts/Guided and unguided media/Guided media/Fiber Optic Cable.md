### 📖 Definition

> A **Fiber Optic Cable** is a high-speed data transmission medium that uses pulses of light to carry information along strands of glass or plastic fibers. It enables the transmission of data over long distances with extremely low loss and high resistance to electromagnetic interference.

## 🧱 Physical Description

A typical fiber optic cable is made up of:

1. **Core**: The central region through which light travels, made of ultra-pure glass or plastic.
    
2. **Cladding**: A surrounding layer of glass or plastic with a lower refractive index, causing light to reflect back into the core via total internal reflection.
    
3. **Buffer Coating**: Protective layer around the cladding to guard against moisture and physical damage.
    
4. **Outer Jacket**: The final protective cover, usually made of plastic, providing mechanical protection.
