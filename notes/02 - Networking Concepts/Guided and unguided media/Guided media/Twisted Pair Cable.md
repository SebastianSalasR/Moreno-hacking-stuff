# 📡 Twisted Pair Cable

**Twisted Pair Cable** is a type of physical transmission medium widely used in telecommunications and computer networks. It consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk between adjacent pairs.

---

## 📏 Physical Description

A **twisted pair cable** contains **two insulated copper conductors** twisted together. The twisting helps cancel out electromagnetic interference from external sources and neighboring pairs within the same cable.

- 📌 **Number of pairs**: Typically 2 or 4 pairs (in Ethernet cables like Cat5e, Cat6)
    
- 📌 **Material**: Copper conductors, individually insulated
    
- 📌 **Twisting**: The number of twists per meter varies to improve resistance against crosstalk

## ⚙️ Characteristics

|Property|Description|
|:--|:--|
|📶 Bandwidth|Moderate to high (depending on category)|
|🔌 Max distance (without repeater)|Typically up to **100 meters** in LANs|
|⚡ Noise Immunity|Improved by twisting the wires|
|💰 Cost|Inexpensive and easy to install|
|🛠️ Installation|Simple, flexible and lightweight|

## 📡 Transmission

- **Signal Type**: Electrical signals
    
- **Method**: Data is transmitted by varying voltages across the two wires of a pair.
    
- **Twisting** helps mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) and **crosstalk** from adjacent wires by ensuring interference affects both wires equally, canceling out the noise.

## 🖥️ Applications

- Local Area Networks (**LANs**)
    
- Telephone lines
    
- CCTV installations
    
- DSL internet connections
    
- Industrial control systems

## 🧵 Types of Twisted Pair Cable

### 🔸 Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

**UTP cables** have no additional shielding around the pairs of wires — only the standard insulation.

- 📌 **Advantages**:
    
    - Cheaper and lighter
        
    - Easier to install
        
- 📌 **Disadvantages**:
    
    - More vulnerable to EMI and crosstalk
        

**Example**: Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6)

### 🔸 Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

**STP cables** have an extra layer of shielding — either around each pair or the entire cable — to provide better protection against interference.

- 📌 **Advantages**:
    
    - Better noise protection
        
    - More stable performance in noisy environments
        
- 📌 **Disadvantages**:
    
    - More expensive and harder to install
        
    - Bulkier and less flexible
        

**Example**: Used in environments with high EMI, like industrial plants or data centers.

|Type|Shielding|Cost|EMI Protection|Use Case|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|UTP|None|Low|Moderate|LANs, general office networking|
|STP|Individual/overall|Higher|High|Industrial, noisy environments|
