## 📡 Antennas

### 📖 What is an Antenna?

An **Antenna** is a device used to transmit and receive electromagnetic waves, converting electrical signals into radio waves (for transmission) and radio waves back into electrical signals (for reception).

Antennas are essential components in all forms of wireless communication — from Wi-Fi networks, mobile phones, and satellites to radio and television broadcasting.

## ⚙️ How Do Antennas Work?

At its core, an antenna operates by:

- **Transmission**: An alternating current (AC) in the antenna generates oscillating electric and magnetic fields, producing electromagnetic waves that propagate through space.
    
- **Reception**: Incoming electromagnetic waves induce a small alternating current in the antenna, converting radio waves back into electrical signals that a receiver can interpret.
    

The **wavelength of the transmitted or received signal** largely determines the size and shape of the antenna. This is why antennas are designed for specific frequency ranges.

## 📡 Parabolic Reflector Antenna

A **Parabolic Reflector Antenna** uses a parabolic-shaped dish to focus incoming radio waves onto a single focal point where the receiver or transmitter element is located.

### 🧭 How it Works:

- Incoming parallel radio waves strike the parabolic dish.
    
- The dish reflects these waves towards its focal point, concentrating their energy.
    
- A receiver (or feed antenna) at this point captures the signal.
    

This type of antenna is highly directional, with a narrow beam, making it ideal for **long-distance, point-to-point communication**.

### 📌 Applications:

- **Satellite communications**
    
- **Radar systems**
    
- **Radio telescopes**
    
- **Microwave links**

## 📈 Antenna Gain

**Antenna Gain** is a measure of how effectively an antenna directs or concentrates radio frequency energy in a particular direction compared to an **isotropic radiator** (a theoretical antenna that radiates equally in all directions).

It’s usually expressed in **dBi (decibels over isotropic)**.

### 📊 Why It Matters:

- A higher gain antenna focuses energy more tightly, increasing signal strength in one direction.
    
- Useful for **long-distance point-to-point links** (like Wi-Fi bridges, satellite dishes) or avoiding interference in unwanted directions.
    

### 📎 Example:

- An omnidirectional Wi-Fi antenna might have a gain of **3 dBi**.
    
- A parabolic dish might have a gain of **30 dBi** or more, focusing its signal in a very narrow beam.
