## üì° Terrestrial Microwave Communication

### üìñ What is Terrestrial Microwave?

**Terrestrial Microwave Communication** is a type of wireless communication that uses **microwave-frequency radio waves** (typically in the 1 GHz to 30 GHz range) to transmit information over long distances between fixed, line-of-sight points on the Earth's surface.

Unlike satellites, which bounce signals from space, terrestrial microwave systems transmit directly between ground-based antennas (usually mounted on towers, rooftops, or mountain tops).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does It Work?

- **Microwave transmitters** send a focused, narrow beam of electromagnetic waves to a **microwave receiver** located at a distant point.
    
- The system requires a **clear line-of-sight** (LOS) because microwaves travel in straight lines and cannot easily bend around obstacles.
    
- The maximum practical distance between towers is typically **30-50 km**, depending on terrain and atmospheric conditions.
    
- To cover longer distances, a series of **repeaters** or relay towers is used.

## üì¶ Physical Description

- Uses **parabolic dish antennas** mounted on towers or tall buildings.
    
- Antennas are typically **0.3 to 3 meters** in diameter.
    
- Highly **directional and focused beams** with narrow angular spread to minimize interference.
    
- Operates in the **microwave frequency spectrum** (typically 2-18 GHz).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Characteristics

| Characteristic              | Description                                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Line-of-sight dependent** | Requires clear, unobstructed path between antennas.                           |
| **High bandwidth**          | Supports large data volumes and multiple channels.                            |
| **Highly directional**      | Minimizes interference and focuses signal strength.                           |
| **Sensitive to weather**    | Rain, fog, and atmospheric conditions can affect performance.                 |
| **Quick deployment**        | Faster to set up than underground or fiber optic cables for remote locations. |

## üì° Transmission

- Data is converted into **microwave signals**.
    
- The transmitting parabolic dish antenna sends a **highly focused beam** to a receiving dish at another location.
    
- Transmission often involves a series of **relay stations** to extend range.
    
- Uses **digital or analog modulation** techniques, such as **QPSK, QAM**, or older **FM and AM** for legacy systems.
